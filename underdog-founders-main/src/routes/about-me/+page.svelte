            Startups are hard. Building them as an underdog is incredibly hard.
            I got curious about the stories of unlikely entrepreneurs winning
            against all odds, and thought you would enjoy reading them too.

            Our second story went viral on LinkedIn, and now I regularly
            document the startup journeys of underdog founders I meet around the
            world.

            I've been in startups for 10 years, most of that time in impact
            investing in Europe, with a few years in Asia. I've held roles as an
            operator (Rocket Internet), VC investor (Mustard Seed Maze), and
            advisor.

            You may have heard about AIsthetic, a viral experiment building a
            company with GPT4 as a CEO. I occasionally deliver corporate
            innovation talks for clients such as BBDO and Pfizer.
